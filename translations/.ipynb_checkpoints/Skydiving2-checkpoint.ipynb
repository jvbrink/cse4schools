Then we used the equations of motion that we know hold for constant acceleration to find the velocity at small steps forward in time. \n",

But unlike a spring, the cord does not exert any force when it is compressed, only when it is stretched. When the jumper jumps from the top of a bridge, the cord is not stretched, and so it does not affect the jumper until she has fallen far enough for the cord to begin to stretch. This point, right before the elastic cord starts to stretch, is known as the point of equilibrium\n",

We place $x=0$ at the point of equilibrium, and we decide that the cord is 20 meters long, so our jumper jumps from a point 20 meters above the the point of equilibrium, that is at $x_0 = 20$m. Let us add a river 60 meters below the bridge."

So these accelerations feel like forces acting on the body, and that is why we call them 'g-forces'.\n",

During a roller coaster ride you will, as the ride progresses, experience a lot of different g-forces when you are accelerating up and down the hills, trough turns and possibly even through loops. You become weightless when there is a quick dive down from a peak in the roller coaster, that is, you experience 0 g or free-fall. An advantage with using g-forces is that they are independent from mass. This means that every person will feel the exact same g-forces during the same roller coaster ride.\n",
