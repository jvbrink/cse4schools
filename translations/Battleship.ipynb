    "Battleship is a board game for two people. Both of the players are given a certain number of ships to place on a grid. First the players place their ships, then they take turns guessing the coordinates of the opponents ship. After a player has made a guess, the opponent has to reveal whether the shot was a hit or a miss. The players have two boards, one to keep track of their own ships, and one to keep track of where they have shot the other player. The picture below show an example of the game board. The white pins signify missed shots, while the red pins signify hits.\n",
