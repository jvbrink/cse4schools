    "Programming is simply to create computer programs. We are surrounded by computer programs (or software) everywhere. For instance Microsoft Word, Mozilla Firefox and Photoshop. Or the apps you have installed on your smart phone. These are all examples of programs, but they are very large programming projects, and they are the result of multiple people working together to create a complete product that can do many things. \n",
    "\n",
    "Most programs are not that large, they are small and specialized. The reason you might not have heard about these kinds of programs, is that they might never have been shared. A lot of programmers write small programs for their own use, and then never share them with anybody. Or, maybe the programs are just hidden from you. Consider, for example, the television you have at home, or your washing machine or your oven. All these things have been programmed to perform specialized tasks. Thousands of programs exists behind the scenes in your daily life. They help make your life easier, and it is exactly the fact that you do not have to think about them that makes them so brilliant. \n",
    "\n",
    "To understand how programming works from a bird eye view you can play a game called [Lightbot](http://lightbot.com/hocflash.html). \n",
    "\n",
    "Below is a screenshot from the game. The goal is to program the little robot and make all the blue fields light up. The little icons at the bottom of the screen are all the available commands you can use. At the right side of the screen, in the box named 'main', is the actual program you are creating.\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"figs\\lightbot1.png\" alt=\"lightbot\" style=\"width: 500px;\" />\n",
    "\n",
    "When you are happy with your program, you can run it by pressing the green arrow at the top of the screen. You can then watch the robot, to see if the program does what you wanted. Either the robot  succeeds and lights all the blue fields (then you have cleared the board), or it fails and nothing happens. Then you just press the orange reset button, change your code, and try again. The game is pretty self explanatory, just make sure you follow the instructions carefully! When programming it is extremely important to be precise.\n",
    "\n",
    "A computer program is written in a programming language. There are many different programming languages. Lightbot uses a symbolic language where you use icons to create a program. In the following tutorial we are going to write code using Python instead. However, the principles you learned by playing Lightbot are the same. Below is an illustration of the workflow we use when we are programming. Do you see how similar the different steps are to the steps you performed when you played Lightbot?\n",
