Workshop: Projectile Motion
===========================

An introduction to computing trajectories
=========================================

This workshop focuses on introducing computations to introductory
physics. Introducing computations should lead to a sense of empowerment
For this to be possible, the computations must 1. Relate to well-known
problems 2. Be shown to be a powerful tool 3. Be understandable.
Students should write their own code

**The goal is to find the velocity and position of an object as
functions of time: :math:`\mathbf{\vec{v}(t), \vec{r}(t) }`**
|cannonball| Equations of motion:

.. math::  \frac{d \vec{r}}{d t} = \vec{v}(t), \qquad \frac{d \vec{v}}{d t} = \vec{a}(t)

.. |cannonball| image:: figs\cannonball.svg

Newtons 2. law of motion:

.. math::  \vec{F} = m\vec{a}

|cannonballforces|

.. |cannonballforces| image:: figs\cannonballforces.svg

.. math::  \vec{F}(r,v,t) = m\vec{a}(r,v,t).

Our algorithm is now as follows 1. Find the physical forces of the
system. 2. Use Newtons 2. law to find the acceleration 3. Calculate ~
v(t) and~ r(t) by solving the equations of motion In this workshop, we
will solve step number 3 numerically, using the Euler method.

The Euler Method
================

A method for solving ordinary differential equations (ODEs)
-----------------------------------------------------------

We can solve the equations of motion numerically using the Euler method
From the definition of the derivative

.. math:: \frac{d v}{d t} = \lim_{\Delta t \to 0} \frac{v(t+\Delta t) - v(t)}{\Delta t} =  a(t)

We now remove the limit, making :math:`\Delta t` a very small constant

.. math:: \frac{v(t+\Delta t) - v(t)}{\Delta t} \approx  a(t)

Solving for :math:`v(t+\Delta t)` gives

.. math::  v(t+\Delta t) \approx v(t) + a(t)\cdot \Delta t 

We can solve the equations of motion by stepping forward in time

.. math:: v(t+\Delta t) = v(t) + a(t)\cdot \Delta t

If :math:`a(t)` and :math:`v(t)` are known, we can calculate
:math:`v(t+\Delta t)` |plot of eulers method|

Our functions are no longer continuous, they have become discretized
====================================================================

We only focus on multiples of our time-step

.. raw:: latex

   \begin{align*}
   t  & \in \{ 0,\ \Delta t,\  2\Delta t, \ 3\Delta t,  \ldots \} \\
   t_i & \equiv i\cdot\Delta t
   \end{align*}

Introduce the shorthand

.. raw:: latex

   \begin{align*}
   v(t_i) & \equiv v_i \\
   r(t_i) & \equiv r_i \\
   \end{align*}

.. figure:: figs\time_discretization.svg
   :alt: time discretization

   time discretization

We solve the equations of motion iteratively
============================================

.. math::  v_{i+1} = v_i + a_i\cdot\Delta t

.. math:: r_{i+1} = r_i + v_i\cdot \Delta t

For each time step, we must calculate the acceleration

.. math::  a_i = a(r_i, v_i, t_i).

We repeat these steps, starting at our initial conditions :math:`v_0`
and :math:`r_0`, until we have reached our end-time :math:`t_N`

.. math::  i = 0,1,2,3,\ldots, N.

Algorithm for the Euler method
==============================

for :math:`i=0,1,2,3,\ldots, N-1`: 1. Use the previous results
:math:`x_i` and :math:`v_i` to compute the acceleration: $ a\_i =
F(x\_i, v\_i, t\_i)/m$. 2. Compute the new velocity: $ v\_{i+1} = v\_i +
a\_i:raw-latex:`\Delta `t$. 3. Compute the new position: $ r\_{i+1} =
r\_i + v\_i:raw-latex:`\Delta `t$.

Implementation
==============

Moving from physics and math to actual computer code
----------------------------------------------------

for :math:`i=0,1,2,3,\ldots, N-1`: 1. Use the previous results
:math:`x_i` and :math:`v_i` to compute the acceleration: $ a\_i =
F(x\_i, v\_i, t\_i)/m$. 2. Compute the new velocity: $ v\_{i+1} = v\_i +
a\_i:raw-latex:`\Delta `t$. 3. Compute the new position: $ r\_{i+1} =
r\_i + v\_i:raw-latex:`\Delta `t$.

.. sagecellserver:: python

    for i in range(N):
    	a[i] = F(r[i], v[i], t[i])/m
    	v[i+1] = v[i] + a[i]*dt
    	r[i+1] = r[i] + v[i]*dt
    	
We want the code to look as much as possible like the physics and math
we write on paper

.. math::  t_i \Rightarrow \texttt{t[i]} \qquad  v_i \Rightarrow \texttt{v[i]} \qquad  r_i  \Rightarrow \texttt{r[i]}

We also need various pieces of bookkeeping code
===============================================

Here we define the arrays we will be using

.. sagecellserver:: python

    #Import various functions meant for numerical science
    import numpy as np 
    from math import cos,sin,pi
    
    t_0 = 0 # Start time, s
    t_end = 10 # End time, s
    N = 1000 # Number of time steps
    
    # Create a uniformly spaced time-array
    t = np.linspace(t_0, t_end, N+1)
    
    # Calculate the size of a time step
    dt = t[1] - t[0]
    
    # Create empty acceleration, velocity and position arrays
    a = np.zeros((N+1,2))
    v = np.zeros((N+1,2))
    r = np.zeros((N+1,2))
    
    # Set initial conditions
    v[0] = (100*cos(pi/6), 100*sin(pi/6)) # inital velocity, m/s
    r[0] = (0,1)  # initial position, m
Here we define the physical constants for our system and the function
that describes the forces

.. sagecellserver:: python

    m = 5.5 # mass, kg
    g = 9.81 # acceleration of gravity, m/s^2
    rho = 1.3 # air density, kg/m^3
    C_D = 0.45 # drag coefficient
    d = 0.11 # diameter of cannonball, m
    A = pi*d**2 # cross-sectional area, m^2
    
    def F(r, v, t):
    	return (0, -m*g) - 0.5*rho*C_D*A*abs(v)*v
This example shows the forces acting on the cannonball as it flies
through the air

.. math:: F(x,v,t) = F_g + F_d(\vec{v}) = -mg\vec{k} - \frac{1}{2}\rho C_D A |\vec{v}|\vec{v}

As soon as we have solved the equations of motion, we can plot the
result

.. sagecellserver:: python

    # Solving equations of motion iteratively
    for i in range(N):
        a[i] = F(r[i], v[i], t[i])/m
        v[i+1] = v[i] + a[i]*dt
        r[i+1] = r[i] + v[i]*dt
    
    # Extract x and y coordinates
    x = r[:,0]
    y = r[:,1]
    
    # Import functionality for plotting
    import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
    %matplotlib inline 
    
    # Plot figure
    plt.plot(x,y)
    
    # Prettify the plot
    plt.xlabel('Horizontal distance, [m]')
    plt.ylabel('Vertical distance, [m]')
    plt.title('Trajectory of a fired cannonball')
    plt.grid()
    plt.axis([0, 900, 0, 250])
    
    # Makes the plot appear on the screen
    plt.show()

Students can use numerical experimentation to build intuition and knowledge
===========================================================================

-  Numerical results can be compared to known analytical solutions. Are
   numerical results trustworthy?
-  Can study how results are directly changed by parameter choice. Are
   the parameters chosen reasonable?
-  Can look at systems with and without certain contributions, such as
   air drag. What is important, and what can be ignored?

Examples of possible projects
=============================

You will have a chance to look at some of these today ###Catapults and
cannons and sports such as baseball \* Easy to compare with experimental
data, either before or after simulation. \* Can look into studies of air
drag, Reynolds number etc. |cannonball|

Skydiving and bungee jumping
============================

-  Great study on free fall and terminal velocity
-  Can study how parameters such as cross-sectional area and drag
   coefficient change as the parachute is opened
-  Can plot the g-forces affecting the jumper. Which sport is more
   “extreme”?

Pendulum and angular motion
